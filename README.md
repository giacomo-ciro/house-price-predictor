# House Price Predictor 
Originally undertaken as part of a student competition during my bachelor's course, this project showcases how advanced machine learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world challenges.  
Armed with a dataset of more than 45,000 houses in Italy, each with their corresponding features and prices, our mission was to devise an accurate model capable of predicting house prices.  
Eventually, I deployed the final model through an interactive webapp [here](https://house-price-predictor.streamlit.app/).

This repo contains:
- *main.ipynb*, the notebook where all the magic happens;
- *report.pdf*, the submitted report which summarizes what I've done and the conclusions I drawn.
